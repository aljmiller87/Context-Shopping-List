This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# State Management with React's Context API

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Conclusions

### Scalability

#### Pros
If the main problem with your application ends up being passing data via props, then Context is the way to go

#### Cons
Context is not as debuggable as Redux.
* If you need to use middleware for various purposes. For example logging actions, error reporting, dispatching other requests depending on the serverâ€™s response, etc
* Redux enables tracking actions and data change

### Cleanliness/Readability

Personally, I find the data flow simpler and easier to read than Redux. 

I think the best way to organize is to have a context folder where you have all context files and providers files located.
